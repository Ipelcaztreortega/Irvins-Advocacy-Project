    <h2>What's the matter with gun violence and what can we do?</h2>

    <p>The use of a gun greatly increases the odds that violence will lead to a fatality: This problem calls for
      urgent
      action.The licensing of handgun purchasers, background check requirements for all gun sales, and close oversight
      of retail gun sellers can reduce the diversion of guns to criminals. Reducing the incidence of gun violence will
      require interventions through multiple systems, including legal, public health, public safety, community, and
      health. Increasing the availability of data and funding will help inform and evaluate policies designed to
      reduce
      gun violence.

        "The effect of guns is not measured by the 41,000 deaths. That's easy to measure, but what are the downstream
        effects of this, in many of these communities and to the public at large? When you're running a healthcare
        organization, we see it each and every day. Millions of people end up in the hospital as a result of gun
        violence. We treat people who come to us with gun injuries. We treat the people that come to us with trauma. We
        treat mental health issues. We treat domestic violence victims. Over 80% of Americans, believe that something
        should be done about gun safety, including gun owners. I think people are afraid to talk about it because people
        automatically jump to the issue of, oh you want to ban guns. I'm not against guns. I'm against the unnecessary
        ill effect of guns that do terrible harm to people." - Michael J.Dowling

  <!--The petition form -->

  <!-- I used one big div, with a second smaller div and two smaller divs inside the second div. This is so that I could use flex row to have it split. Inside the big div, it follows a flex-direction of column so, it goes, h2, then the paragrahp and the signatures and the form last. But since the second div uses flex-direction of row so that way under the h2 tag the paragraph and signatures will be side by side. I guess I will call this method the inside method.-->
